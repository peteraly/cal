# ✅ **PACERS RUNNING SCRAPER COMPLETELY FIXED!**

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

The Pacers Running scraper was showing "0 events scraped" but the website actually had 3 upcoming races. The issue was that our generic Shopify scraper wasn't properly detecting the specific HTML structure used by Pacers Running.

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Root Cause Analysis** ✅
- **Issue**: Generic Shopify scraper couldn't parse Pacers Running's specific HTML structure
- **Events Found**: 3 races were clearly visible on the website:
  - JINGLE 5K (December 14, 2025)
  - PNC ALEXANDRIA HALF (April 26, 2026)
  - DC Half (September 20, 2026)

### **2. Specialized Scraper Created** ✅
- **Added Shopify Detection**: Enhanced scraper now detects Shopify stores
- **Created Pacers-Specific Parser**: `_scrape_pacers_running_events()` method
- **Improved HTML Parsing**: Targets specific CSS classes (`h2.h0`, `strong`, `div.rte`)
- **Smart Date Parsing**: Handles race date formats correctly
- **Location Extraction**: Automatically extracts locations from descriptions

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling** ✅
- **Robust HTML Parsing**: Handles various HTML element types safely
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debug information for troubleshooting
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continues processing even if individual elements fail
