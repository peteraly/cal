Jennifer Closes' "The Hopefuls" is discussed during Read & Run on the Road book club
FULL DESCRIPTION
On this 3.3 mile, easy-paced book club run, we'll see DC through the eyes of a New Yorker who's reluctantly moved to Dupont Circle/Kalorama.
This 3.3 mile, easy-paced book club run, is for anyone who's moved to DC, perhaps reluctantly, or who'd like to poke some fun at the things that can make this city an odd place to live.
The Hopefuls is about a young married couple that moves from NYC to DC because it's the husband's lifelong dream to run for office. The narrator (the wife) was reluctant to move and has a lot of complaints about DC: the constant politicking, the weather, and the metro—to name a few. Let's talk about big transitions in life and how the circumstances of those moves can impact how we see our new city in this lighthearted book.
On the route for this Read & Run on the Road event, created and led by me (Chelsey Stone), we'll stop at several locations to visit significant places throughout the story.
Learn more on my website: chelseygrassfield.com
(P.S. I'd like to eliminate fees for you and me, so if you happen to mosey on over to my webpage above, there's info on how to venmo and register via google forms.)
PREPARE: As this event is a book club run, it focuses on the plot, characters, and story. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the book ahead of time to have the best experience. There is runner participation in the stops and opportunities for discussion, thoughts, and questions—similar to a traditional book club.
Physical and digital copies of the book are available at the DC Public Library.
INCLEMENT WEATHER PLAN: If weather creates unsafe conditions, we will hold the discussion at The Exchange Saloon (1719 G St NW) at 6 p.m. I will inform you no later than Tuesday, September 16 by noon if an alternate event will take place.

Andie Burke discusses "With Stars in Her Eyes" with Stephanie Jenks
FULL DESCRIPTION
Celebrating the latest release from local author Andie Burke!
Please join us at C. Burr Artz Library on Tuesday, September 16 from 6:00-7:00 pm to celebrate all things "sapphic bookstore romance" with us and local author Andie Burke! Andie will be discussing her latest novel, With Stars in Her Eyes, with local book club host Stephanie Jenks. This story centers on love found in the most bookish of places; when cellist Courtney returns home for a respite from a botched performance and spiraling rumors, she stumbles into love with a newcomer looking for a fresh start… who happens to work in the tattoo shop next door to Courtney's best friend's bookshop. After her conversation, Andie will answer questions and sign books. Copies of With Stars in Her Eyes will be available for purchase at the event. 
This free, public event is presented in partnership with Frederick County Public Libraries. For accessibility requests, email info@curiousiguana.com at least two (2) weeks prior to the event.
About the book: A swoon-worthy sapphic bookstore romance about fresh starts and finding that one person who feels like home from breakout author Andie Burke (Fly with Me).
Seconds from a meteoric career launch, cellist Courtney Starling suffers a frightening migraine attack during a key performance. While harmful rumors fly, she escapes to her happy place—her best friend's Kansas bookshop. Courtney's working incognito when a scream sends her leaping off a shelving ladder to find the woman who screamed cowering near the register.
When Thea Quinn dropped in for a misdelivered package, she did not expect a mortifying encounter with a bearded dragon in front of an inconveniently attractive bookseller. Clutching an upcoming book club flyer and the tattered shreds of her dignity, she heads back to her new piercing job at the tattoo shop next door. She moved to this quirky place for a fresh start. But maybe the meet-disaster was a sign? Maybe Thea needs to branch out beyond her photography hobby and connect with new people…like at a historical romance book club run by a particularly mysterious and sexy bookseller with a pixie cut?
Friendly lunches become stolen moments between the bookshelves. Courtney and Thea's old problems feel eons away. But just as their chemistry heats to a combustion point, consequences from Courtney's past arrive literally on her doorstep at exactly the wrong moment. New revelations and surprising connections take the pair from feeling joyfully lovestruck to confusingly star-crossed. Both women must decide what they're willing to give up for happily ever after.
About the author: Andie Burke specializes in big-hearted queer romcoms that kick-off with meet-disasters rather than meet-cutes. When not writing, she works as a pediatric radiology nurse. She lives with two small but hilarious humans in a Maryland home filled with an alarming number of books, ultra-fine point pens, and dehydrated houseplants. She is the author of Fall for Him as well as Fly with Me, one of Autostraddle's Best Queer Books of the Year.

David J. Lynch discusses "The World's Worst Bet: How the Globalization Gamble Went Wrong (And What Would Make It Right)" with David Ignatius
FULL DESCRIPTION
The triumphant globalization that began in the 1990s has given way to a world riven by conflict, populism, and economic nationalism. In The World's Worst Bet, David J. Lynch offers a trenchant, fast-paced narrative of the rise and fall of the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known. Lynch explains what went right, what went wrong, and what needs to change to preserve the benefits of global integration and to build prosperity for all Americans.
Lynch brings a deep understanding of the forces affecting Americans' lives to his portrayal of a fascinating cast of characters: presidents and policymakers; factory workers whose anger over lost jobs reshaped a nation's politics; and the anti-globalization warriors of the right and left. Their stories show how the United States made a bad bet on globalization, gambling that it could enjoy its benefits while ignoring its costs: dislocated workers, vulnerable supply chains, and the rise of a powerful rival. With trillions of dollars now at stake, The World's Worst Bet explains the failings of the past and offers an insightful guide to the opportunities of the future.
David J. Lynch is the global economics correspondent of the Washington Post. The recipient of the National Press Foundation's Hinrich Award for Distinguished Reporting on Trade in 2021, Lynch has reported from more than sixty countries for the Post and earlier in his career with the Financial Times of London, Bloomberg News, and USA Today. He lives in Vienna, Virginia.
Lynch will be in conversation with David Ignatius. Ignatius is a prize-winning columnist for the Washington Post and has been covering the Middle East and the CIA for four decades. He has written several New York Times bestsellers. He lives in Washington, DC.

Chet'la Sebree discusses "Blue Opening" with Thea Brown
FULL DESCRIPTION
Blue Opening, Chet'la Sebree's brilliant, illuminating poetry collection, grapples with origins--of illness, of language, of the universe--as the speaker contemplates whether she, too, can be a site of origin through motherhood. Navigating chronic health challenges alongside grief and questions about the nature of knowledge and religion, she searches personal history and the cosmos for answers to the unknowable.
With startling clarity and vivid tenderness, Blue Opening calls into question not only where to begin, but how to create, across thirty-two poems that press the fluid boundaries of form through sonnets, prose poems, odes, and two unforgettable poetic sequences. As the speaker traverses loss, possibility, and the choice, or often the lack of choice, in the direction of her future, she determines to press forward even as she is "unsure of what shape this language should take / and hulling, from blue rock, faith."
Chet'la Sebree is the author of Field Study, winner of the 2020 James Laughlin Award from the Academy of American Poets, and Mistress. Raised in the mid-Atlantic, she earned an MFA in creative writing, with a focus in poetry, from American University. Chet'la's poetry and prose have appeared in Colorado Review, Kenyon Review, Lit Hub, Pleiades, Guernica, Poetry International, and The Yale Review. Currently, Chet'la is an assistant professor of English at George Washington University and teaches in the low-residency MFA program at Randolph College. Her debut essay collection is forthcoming from The Dial Press in 2026.
Sebree will be in conversation with Thea Brown, the author of three collections of poetry, most recently Loner Forensics (Northwestern University Press 2023). Her poems can be found in Action, Spectacle, Bennington Review, River Styx, Oversound, Iowa Review, Lit Hub, and elsewhere. She lives in Baltimore and teaches creative writing at the George Washington University.

Enter for the chance to win a pair of tickets to Garbage
on September 17, 2025
Let All That We Imagine Be The Light marks Garbage's eighth studio album—an expansive, explosive, and deeply human work born out of upheaval. Unlike anything before, it arrived unexpectedly, forged in the wake of crisis. In August 2024, frontwoman Shirley Manson was forced off the stage after an old injury resurfaced, leading to surgery and months of grueling rehab. With her cane in hand and determination in her stride, she and her bandmates, Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, and Steve Marker faced a year turned upside down. Out of that void, they turned to the one constant that's always carried them: making music. The result is a record that stares down catastrophe and emerges with beauty, hope, and fire. As Shirley puts it: "This record is about what it means to be alive, and about what it means to face your imminent destruction. It's hopeful. It's tender. It celebrates our flaws and failures as part of what makes us human ."Thrilling and vulnerable in equal measure, Let All That We Imagine Be The Light is Garbage at their most raw, reflective, and resilient—a reminder that fragility can still spark brilliance.

The preeminent historian of the Civil War era, Foner's keynote has been American freedom and its changing meanings and boundaries.

Together they show the range of his interests and expertise, running from slavery and antislavery through the disunion and remaking of the United States in the nineteenth century, Jim Crow and the civil rights movement, and into our own political moment. Each piece shows a master at work, melding historical knowledge and balanced judgment with fine prose.

Trymaine Lee discusses "A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America" with Joy Reid
FULL DESCRIPTION
A few years ago, Trymaine Lee, though fit and only 38, nearly died of a heart attack. When his then five-year-old daughter, Nola, asked her daddy why, he realized that to answer her honestly, he had to confront what almost killed him--the weight of being a Black man in America; of bearing witness, as a journalist, to relentless Black death; and of a family history scarred by enslavement, lynching, the Great Migration, the also insidious racism of the North, and gun violence that stole the lives of two great-uncles, a grandfather, a stepbrother, and two cousins.
In this powerful narrative, Lee weaves together three strands: the long and bloody history of African Americans and guns; his work as a chronicler of gun violence, tallying the costs and riches generated by both the legal and illegal gun industries; and his own life story. With unflinching honesty he takes readers on a journey, from almost being caught up in gun violence as a young man, to tracing the legacy of the Middle Passage in Ghana through his ancestors' footsteps, to confronting the challenges of representing his people in an overwhelmingly white and often hostile media world, and most importantly, to celebrating the enduring strength of his family and community.
In A Thousand Ways to Die, Lee answers Nola and all who seek a more just America. He shares the hard truths and complexities of the Black experience, but he also celebrates the beauty and resilience that is Nola's legacy.
Trymaine Lee is a Pulitzer Prize and Emmy award winning journalist and MSNBC contributor. He's the host of the "Into America" podcast where he covers the intersection of Blackness, power, and politics. A contributing author to the "1619 Project", he has reported for The New York Times, the Huffington Post, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune. A Thousand Ways to Die is his first book.
Lee will be in conversation with Joy Reid, a New York Times best-selling author, political commentator and analyst with 30-plus years in the media business. Most recently, for five years For five years, she was the host of the two-time NAACP Award-winning and Emmy nominated nightly news analysis program, "The ReidOut" on MSNBC. Prior to that she hosted the weekend program: "A.M. Joy" (2016-2020) which became MSNBC's highest ever rated weekend program, and a daily news show: "The Reid Report" from 2014-2015. Reid has written four books including two New York Times best sellers: Medgar and Myrlie; a New York Times number one bestseller and The Man Who Sold America, which spent four weeks on the list; as well as Fracture: Barack Obama, The Clintons and the Racial Divide and We are the Change We Seek: the speeches of Barack Obama (with Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne) as well as the foreword to Kamala Harris: The Official White House Photos. A 1991 Harvard graduate, Reid is the mother of four and she and her husband run a documentary film production company, Image Lab Media Goup.

Sasha Bonét discusses "The Waterbearers: A Memoir of Mothers and Daughters" with Glory Edim
FULL DESCRIPTION
Betty Jean, the author's grandmother, had a house along a bayou in Texas, a home paid for and run without a man by her side. This home served as the center of Bonét's family's universe, the one place that was a constant through all of life's changes.
Mama Connie, one of Betty Jean's eleven children, vowed that her life would be different. And in many ways it was: she got married, lived in suburbia, and built a life resembling the American dream. But when it came to raising children of her own, she was more like Betty Jean than she cared to admit. But, like her mother before her, Connie's sweat was the founding salt of her own universe.
Today, Sasha Bonét navigates all aspects of being a mother--escape, promise, burden, assent, and rebellion--not just for the women in her family who came before her, but for Black women with whom society is acquainted, too: figures like Nina Simone, Betty Davis, and Darnella Frazier, who filmed the murder of George Floyd.
Generations of Black women have borne children, borne the burdens of events untold, and borne witness to unspeakable trials. The Waterbearers carries this history, its fierce eloquence capturing a masterpiece of life written by an author who is intimately acquainted with how Black women have passed down knowledge and culture. Sasha Bonét doesn't just present genealogical lineages but illuminates the cultural and societal connections of strong Black women who have built legacies and changed the world, sometimes in the most mundane of moments. The fierce eloquence of this story confirms Sasha Bonét as a voice we all now need to hear.
Sasha Bonét is a writer and cultural critic based in New York City. Her criticism and essays have appeared in The Paris Review, Aperture, New York Magazine, Vogue, and BOMB, among other publications. Bonét is a professor of creative writing for Columbia University and Barnard College.
Bonét will be in conversation with Glory Edim, a literary taste maker, entrepreneur, and advocate for diverse voices in literature. In 2015, she founded Well-Read Black Girl (WRBG), an online platform and book club dedicated to celebrating the works of Black women authors and creating a supportive online community for readers. Under Edim's leadership, WRBG has grown into a nonprofit organization, hosting events, book festivals, and author conversations that highlight the richness and diversity of Black literature. Her efforts have earned her accolades such as the 2017 Innovator's Award from the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes and the Madam C.J. Walker Award from the Hurston/Wright Foundation. As an author herself, Edim has contributed to the literary landscape with her bestselling anthologies Well-Read Black Girl: Finding Our Stories, Discovering Ourselves, and On Girlhood: 15 Stories from the Well-Read Black Girl Library and her recently published book Gather Me.

David Gelles discusses "Dirtbag Billionaire: How Yvon Chouinard Built Patagonia, Made a Fortune, and Gave It All Away" with Teddy Schleifer
FULL DESCRIPTION
This is the inside story of one of the most extraordinary brands in the corporate world, the rare company that is driven by environmental activism instead of cutthroat capitalism. Founded in 1973, Patagonia has grown into a wildly popular producer of jackets, hats, and fleece vests, with a cultlike following among hardcore alpinists and Wall Street traders alike, posting sales of more than $1 billion a year.
But it's not just the clothes that make Patagonia unique. For decades, the company has distinguished itself as a singular beacon for socially responsible business, the rare company that can legitimately claim to be doing its damnedest to make the world a better place, while also making a profit. From its early efforts to take exemplary care of its employees, to its extensive work trying to clean up its supply chain, to its controversial activism, Patagonia has set itself apart from its peers with one unorthodox decision after another, proving that there is another way to do capitalism.
At the heart of the story is Patagonia's founder, the legendary rock climber Yvon Chouinard. A perennial outsider who forged one of the most impressive resumes in the outdoor world, Chouinard also established himself as a pivotal figure in the history of American business. Guided by his anti-authoritarian streak and his unwavering commitment to preserving the natural world, Patagonia came to exert a powerful influence on other companies, paving the way for a new era of social and environmental responsibility. He started out as a dirtbag--a term affectionately bestowed on poor, itinerant outdoorsmen so uninterested in material possessions they are happy to sleep in the dirt--and he became a billionaire.
Chouinard also proved that there was another way to be a philanthropist. In the twilight of his career, he gave away Patagonia, renouncing his wealth and committing all its future profits to fighting the climate crisis.
Drawing on exclusive access to Chouinard and the Patagonia team, Dirtbag Billionaire offers new insights into the key moments that informed their priorities, shaped the company, and sent ripples across the corporate world.
David Gelles is an award-winning correspondent for the New York Times. He currently writes for the climate desk and previously wrote for the business section and was the "Corner Office" columnist. His book, The Man Who Broke Capitalism, was an instant New York Times bestseller.
Gelles will be in conversation with Teddy Schleifer, who covers billionaires and their impact on the world for The New York Times.
