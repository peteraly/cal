Jennifer Closes' "The Hopefuls" is discussed during Read & Run on the Road book club
FULL DESCRIPTION
On this 3.3 mile, easy-paced book club run, we'll see DC through the eyes of a New Yorker who's reluctantly moved to Dupont Circle/Kalorama.
This 3.3 mile, easy-paced book club run, is for anyone who's moved to DC, perhaps reluctantly, or who'd like to poke some fun at the things that can make this city an odd place to live.
The Hopefuls is about a young married couple that moves from NYC to DC because it's the husband's lifelong dream to run for office. The narrator (the wife) was reluctant to move and has a lot of complaints about DC: the constant politicking, the weather, and the metro—to name a few. Let's talk about big transitions in life and how the circumstances of those moves can impact how we see our new city in this lighthearted book.
On the route for this Read & Run on the Road event, created and led by me (Chelsey Stone), we'll stop at several locations to visit significant places throughout the story.
Learn more on my website: chelseygrassfield.com
(P.S. I'd like to eliminate fees for you and me, so if you happen to mosey on over to my webpage above, there's info on how to venmo and register via google forms.)
PREPARE: As this event is a book club run, it focuses on the plot, characters, and story. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the book ahead of time to have the best experience. There is runner participation in the stops and opportunities for discussion, thoughts, and questions—similar to a traditional book club.
Physical and digital copies of the book are available at the DC Public Library.
INCLEMENT WEATHER PLAN: If weather creates unsafe conditions, we will hold the discussion at The Exchange Saloon (1719 G St NW) at 6 p.m. I will inform you no later than Tuesday, September 16 by noon if an alternate event will take place.

Andie Burke discusses "With Stars in Her Eyes" with Stephanie Jenks

Andie Burke discusses "With Stars in Her Eyes" with Stephanie Jenks
FULL DESCRIPTION
Celebrating the latest release from local author Andie Burke!
Please join us at C. Burr Artz Library on Tuesday, September 16 from 6:00-7:00 pm to celebrate all things "sapphic bookstore romance" with us and local author Andie Burke! Andie will be discussing her latest novel, With Stars in Her Eyes, with local book club host Stephanie Jenks. This story centers on love found in the most bookish of places; when cellist Courtney returns home for a respite from a botched performance and spiraling rumors, she stumbles into love with a newcomer looking for a fresh start… who happens to work in the tattoo shop next door to Courtney's best friend's bookshop. After her conversation, Andie will answer questions and sign books. Copies of With Stars in Her Eyes will be available for purchase at the event. 
This free, public event is presented in partnership with Frederick County Public Libraries. For accessibility requests, email info@curiousiguana.com at least two (2) weeks prior to the event.
About the book: A swoon-worthy sapphic bookstore romance about fresh starts and finding that one person who feels like home from breakout author Andie Burke (Fly with Me).
Seconds from a meteoric career launch, cellist Courtney Starling suffers a frightening migraine attack during a key performance. While harmful rumors fly, she escapes to her happy place—her best friend's Kansas bookshop. Courtney's working incognito when a scream sends her leaping off a shelving ladder to find the woman who screamed cowering near the register.
When Thea Quinn dropped in for a misdelivered package, she did not expect a mortifying encounter with a bearded dragon in front of an inconveniently attractive bookseller. Clutching an upcoming book club flyer and the tattered shreds of her dignity, she heads back to her new piercing job at the tattoo shop next door. She moved to this quirky place for a fresh start. But maybe the meet-disaster was a sign? Maybe Thea needs to branch out beyond her photography hobby and connect with new people…like at a historical romance book club run by a particularly mysterious and sexy bookseller with a pixie cut?
Friendly lunches become stolen moments between the bookshelves. Courtney and Thea's old problems feel eons away. But just as their chemistry heats to a combustion point, consequences from Courtney's past arrive literally on her doorstep at exactly the wrong moment. New revelations and surprising connections take the pair from feeling joyfully lovestruck to confusingly star-crossed. Both women must decide what they're willing to give up for happily ever after.
About the author: Andie Burke specializes in big-hearted queer romcoms that kick-off with meet-disasters rather than meet-cutes. When not writing, she works as a pediatric radiology nurse. She lives with two small but hilarious humans in a Maryland home filled with an alarming number of books, ultra-fine point pens, and dehydrated houseplants. She is the author of Fall for Him as well as Fly with Me, one of Autostraddle's Best Queer Books of the Year.

David J. Lynch discusses "The World's Worst Bet: How the Globalization Gamble Went Wrong (And What Would Make It Right)" with David Ignatius
FULL DESCRIPTION
The triumphant globalization that began in the 1990s has given way to a world riven by conflict, populism, and economic nationalism. In The World's Worst Bet, David J. Lynch offers a trenchant, fast-paced narrative of the rise and fall of the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known. Lynch explains what went right, what went wrong, and what needs to change to preserve the benefits of global integration and to build prosperity for all Americans.
Lynch brings a deep understanding of the forces affecting Americans' lives to his portrayal of a fascinating cast of characters: presidents and policymakers; factory workers whose anger over lost jobs reshaped a nation's politics; and the anti-globalization warriors of the right and left. Their stories show how the United States made a bad bet on globalization, gambling that it could enjoy its benefits while ignoring its costs: dislocated workers, vulnerable supply chains, and the rise of a powerful rival. With trillions of dollars now at stake, The World's Worst Bet explains the failings of the past and offers an insightful guide to the opportunities of the future.
David J. Lynch is the global economics correspondent of the Washington Post. The recipient of the National Press Foundation's Hinrich Award for Distinguished Reporting on Trade in 2021, Lynch has reported from more than sixty countries for the Post and earlier in his career with the Financial Times of London, Bloomberg News, and USA Today. He lives in Vienna, Virginia.
Lynch will be in conversation with David Ignatius. Ignatius is a prize-winning columnist for the Washington Post and has been covering the Middle East and the CIA for four decades. He has written several New York Times bestsellers. He lives in Washington, DC.
