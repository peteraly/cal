## 🎯 **What to Look For in QA Results**

### **✅ Success Indicators**
- **High Event Count**: Should find 20+ events for sites like Aspen Institute
- **Correct Strategy**: Should detect `javascript_heavy` for Load More sites
- **Fast Response**: Should complete in under 10 seconds
- **Sample Events**: Should show real event titles and dates
- **No Errors**: Should not show connection or parsing errors

- **Connection Errors**: DNS resolution or timeout errors
- **Empty Results**: No events found at all

### **🔍 Debugging Tips**
1. **Check Network**: Ensure internet connection is working

3. **Check URL Patterns**: Use `test_url_patterns.py` to see which patterns work
4. **Review Logs**: Look for error messages in the output
5. **Test Different Sites**: Try sites you know have Load More buttons
