# 🎉 RSS Feeds Access Fixed!

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The RSS feeds page was redirecting back to the admin login instead of showing the RSS management dashboard. This has been completely resolved.

---

## 🚨 **What Was the Problem?**

1. **Session Key Mismatch** - The login was setting `session['admin_logged_in']` but the decorators were checking for different session keys
2. **Missing RSS Manager Methods** - The RSS manager was missing several methods that the app.py was trying to call
3. **Database Column Mismatch** - The RSS manager was looking for `enabled` column but the table had `is_active`

---

## 🛠️ **How It Was Fixed:**

### **1. Fixed Authentication Issues:**
- **Unified session keys** - Both `login_required` and `require_auth` decorators now use `session['admin_logged_in']`
- **Fixed login route** - Now properly sets `session['admin_logged_in'] = True`
- **Fixed logout route** - Now properly clears `session['admin_logged_in']`

### **2. Added Missing RSS Manager Methods:**
- `get_all_feeds()` - Get all RSS feeds
- `update_feed()` - Update an RSS feed
- `delete_feed()` - Delete an RSS feed
- `refresh_feed()` - Manually refresh a specific feed
- `refresh_all_feeds()` - Manually refresh all feeds
- `get_logs()` - Get RSS feed logs
- `get_categories()` - Get available categories
- `override_event_source()` - Override event source

### **3. Fixed Database Queries:**
- Changed `enabled` to `is_active` in all queries
- Updated column references to match the actual database schema
