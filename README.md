## AI Features

### Smart Entry
Type natural language descriptions in the admin interface:
- "Team sync with Sam at 10am next Wednesday in Zoom"
- "Lunch with John tomorrow at 12:30pm"
- "Project deadline next Friday at 5pm"

The AI will automatically parse:
- **Title**: Extracted from the description
- **Date**: Parsed from relative terms (tomorrow, next Wednesday, etc.)
- **Time**: Extracted and converted to 24-hour format
- **Location**: Identified from context (Zoom, office, etc.)
- **Tags**: Auto-generated based on content (Meeting, Online, Work, etc.)
- **Description**: Auto-generated if not provided

### Intelligent Features
- **Auto-tagging**: Events are automatically tagged based on content
- **Importance Detection**: Events with keywords like "launch", "deadline", "urgent" are highlighted
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recurring event patterns are detected and suggested
- **Analytics**: View event patterns, popular times, and category distributions

### AI Configuration
The app works with or without an OpenAI API key:
- **With OpenAI**: Uses GPT-3.5 for advanced natural language processing
- **Without OpenAI**: Uses intelligent regex patterns and date parsing libraries

## Search Features

### Natural Language Search
The public calendar includes a powerful search bar that understands natural language queries:

**Date-based searches:**
- "events next week"
- "meetings this week" 
- "workshops in October"
- "events next Monday"

**Tag-based searches:**
- "zoom calls on Friday"
- "lunch meetings"
- "work events"
- "online workshops"

**Keyword searches:**
- "team sync"
- "project deadline"
- "client meetings"

**Time-based searches:**
- "morning meetings"
- "afternoon events"
- "evening workshops"

The search automatically parses your query and filters events by:
- **Keywords**: Searches in titles, descriptions, and locations
- **Tags**: Matches event tags (Meeting, Online, Work, etc.)
- **Date ranges**: Understands relative dates (next week, tomorrow, etc.)
- **Time ranges**: Filters by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Locations**: Finds events at specific locations

## Subscription Features

### Smart Subscriptions (No Account Required)
The calendar includes a minimal subscription system that works entirely in the browser:

**Subscription Types:**
- **üîî Event Subscriptions**: Follow specific events for updates
- **‚≠ê Host Subscriptions**: Follow all events by a particular host/organizer
- **üè¢ Venue Subscriptions**: Follow all events at a specific location
- **üè∑Ô∏è Tag Subscriptions**: Follow events with specific tags (e.g., "workshop", "music")

**How It Works:**
1. **Local Storage**: All subscriptions are stored in your browser's localStorage
2. **No Accounts**: No email or user registration required
3. **Instant Setup**: Click buttons on events to subscribe immediately
4. **Smart Suggestions**: Browse available hosts, venues, and tags to follow
5. **Visual Management**: See all your subscriptions in one place

**Usage:**
- Click "üîî Follow Event" on any event to subscribe
- Click "‚≠ê Follow Host" to follow all events by that organizer
- Click "üè¢ Follow Venue" to follow all events at that location
- Use the "Manage" button to browse and toggle subscriptions
- Subscriptions persist across browser sessions

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  subscriptions: {
    event: [1, 2, 3],           // Event IDs
    host: ["John Smith", "Tech Meetup"],  // Host names
    venue: ["Conference Center", "Zoom"], // Venue names
    tag: ["workshop", "music"]   // Tag names
  }
}
```

## Pricing Information

### Smart Price Detection
The calendar automatically detects and displays pricing information for events:

**Price Display Logic:**
- **Free Events**: Shows "üí∞ Free" in green
- **Paid Events**: Shows "üí∞ $25" in blue  
- **Mixed Pricing**: Shows "üí∞ Free; dog show $25" for events with both free and paid components

**Examples:**
- `"Free admission"` ‚Üí **Free**
- `"$25 per person"` ‚Üí **$25**
- `"Free; dog show registration $25"` ‚Üí **Free; $25**
- `"Tickets start at $35. Premium seating $75"` ‚Üí **$35, $75**

**How It Works:**
1. **AI Parsing**: When using smart entry, the system automatically extracts price information from event descriptions
2. **Manual Entry**: Admins can manually specify pricing in the "Price Information" field
3. **Smart Detection**: The system uses regex patterns to find dollar amounts and "free" mentions
4. **Visual Display**: Price information is prominently displayed with color coding (green for free, blue for paid)

**Usage:**
- **For Admins**: Add pricing in the "Price Information" field when creating/editing events
- **For AI**: The system automatically detects pricing from natural language descriptions
- **For Visitors**: Price information is clearly displayed on each event

## Bulk Import Feature

### Smart Event Extraction
The calendar includes a powerful bulk import feature that can extract multiple events from structured text like news articles or event listings.

**How It Works:**
1. **Paste Text**: Copy and paste event information from articles, websites, or documents
2. **AI Extraction**: The system automatically identifies and separates individual events
3. **Preview & Edit**: Review extracted events before importing
4. **Bulk Import**: Import all events at once with automatic parsing

**Supported Formats:**
- News articles with date headers (e.g., "Thursday, Sept. 4")
- Event listings with clear titles and descriptions
- Structured text with time, location, and pricing information

**Example Usage:**
1. Go to Admin Interface ‚Üí "Bulk Import" button
2. Paste text from a Washington Post "Things to Do" article
3. Click "Extract Events" to parse the content
4. Review the extracted events in the preview
5. Remove any unwanted events
6. Click "Import All Events" to add them to your calendar

**Features:**
- **Multiple Extraction Methods**: Choose from Enhanced (rule-based), Advanced (NLP), or AI-Powered (LLM) extraction
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically extracts titles, dates, times, locations, and pricing
- **Preview Mode**: See exactly what will be imported before committing
- **Selective Import**: Remove individual events from the import list
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback on successful and failed imports
- **Batch Processing**: Import multiple events efficiently
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatically falls back to simpler methods if advanced ones fail

### Advanced Extraction Methods

#### Enhanced (Rule-based) - Default
- Fast, reliable pattern matching
- Works offline with no external dependencies
- Best for structured text with clear event boundaries

#### Advanced (NLP) - Optional
- Uses spaCy and NLTK for better language understanding
- Named Entity Recognition for dates, times, and locations
- Best for complex text with varied formatting
- Install with: `pip install -r requirements-advanced.txt`

#### AI-Powered (LLM) - Most Accurate
- Uses OpenAI GPT for semantic understanding
- Handles any text format with high accuracy
- Best for unstructured text and complex articles
- Requires OpenAI API key in `.env`

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
The app runs in debug mode by default when using `python app.py`. This enables:
- Auto-reload on code changes
- Detailed error messages
- Debug toolbar (if installed)

### Customization
- Modify `templates/` for UI changes
- Update `app.py` for backend logic
- Customize Tailwind classes for styling
- Add new API endpoints as needed

## Security Notes

- Change the default admin password in production
- Use a strong SECRET_KEY for session management
- Consider using environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement proper password hashing for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - The app is configured to run on port 5001 by default to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay
   - If needed, change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5002)`

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete `calendar.db` and restart the app to recreate the database

3. **Login not working**
   - Check your `.env` file has the correct `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - Ensure the `.env` file is in the project root

4. **Static files not loading**
   - Ensure you're using the CDN versions of Tailwind and Alpine.js (included in templates)
