# District Fray Scraper Fix

## Problem
The scraper was extracting location names and categories as events instead of actual events.

## Solution
Created specialized `_scrape_district_fray_events` method that:
- Filters out navigation elements
- Extracts actual event data
- Handles date parsing with @ symbols
- Deduplicates events

## Results
Now correctly extracts 38 actual events with proper titles, dates, locations, and URLs.

## Key Methods Added
- `_scrape_district_fray_events()`
- `_is_filter_or_nav_element()`
- `_contains_event_data()`
- `_parse_date_flexible()`
- `_deduplicate_events()`

The scraper automatically detects districtfray.com URLs and uses the specialized strategy.
